  <h1>My flyers</h1>
<div class="img-1">
  <h2>DORMA 21 Presents: in-store Session w/ Dumbo Beat - Nudge / Bolo Represent (IT)</h2>
  <img src="img/bolo-dorma-flyer.jpg" alt="">
  <p>This is a flyer I did back in May 2019 when we had a pre-Distortion in-store session.</p>
  <p>We were supposed to have rising star Dumbo Beat aka Umberto from the
  city of Bologna, Italy who was in Copenhagen to play at Distortion the day
  after, however, he had to cancel last minute due to personal complications.
  In his place we had Icelandic Thorsteinss√∏n play with the DORMA 21 staff. </p>
